        <=== BATTLESHIP2020 RULES ===>

        This is a boardgame to be played by 2 players: you and your opponent.
        The player with the highest score, wins the game.
        On the board are 4 ships, one of every type described in the table below.
        Every other turn you have to decide on a location from a grid (10x10 tiles by default) to bomb. 
        Bombing can only hit one tile and may result in hitting one of the ships which is rewarded with points as listed in the table.
        When all the tiles, occupied by ship, are hit, the ship sinks, and the points per-hit are doubled.
        The game ends when all the ships are down. In that case the player with the highest score, wins the game.

                            Size    Points-Per-Hit    Points-When-sunk      Color      
        Carrier             5               1                 2                 Green
        Battleship          4               2                 4                 Magenta
        Submarine           3               3                 6                 Yellow
        Destroyer           2               4                 8                 Black

        Before starting the game, there are a few options:
        • One can insert a configuration file in which the board dimensions and the locations of the ships are specified.
                This file can be selected by clicking on the “Select config file” button.
                The format for inserting the ship types and according coordinates is as follows: 
                        •	dimension of square board, i.e. the number of rows and hence also columns
                        •	4x Ship type from Table 1; Coordinate 1, Coordinate 2, … 
                                and each coordinate is formatted as follows: row_number * column_number
                                ATTENTION, row and column numbers can go from 0 -> board dimension -1!!

                Example:
                8
                Carrier;3*2;3*3;3*4;3*5;3*6 
                Battleship;5*6;6*6;7*6;8*6 
                Submarine;5*2;6*2;7*2;
                Destroyer;1*7;1*8

        • Second, one can insert Player1's and Player2's name.
        • Third, dimensions for the board can be set, minimum is 5 for both the rows as the number of columns.
        • Fourth, the players can also choose a scoring system:
                1.	same points-per-hit for each player 
                2.	unique points-per-hit for each player: normal score * (11/10)^flag 
                        This flag value is 1 for Player2's scores as this players has the disadvantage
                        of starting as second.

        Finally, one can enter the highscores, check these rules or just play the game. 

        Remark:
        * All settings set are automatically taking into account if one presses 'Play Game'.
